# openshell-driver-kubernetes

Kubernetes-backed compute driver for OpenShell cluster deployments.

The driver uses the Kubernetes API to create, delete, fetch, and watch sandbox
custom resources. It runs in-process with the gateway server and supports three
workspace namespace modes via `workspace_mode`:

- **Shared** (default): All sandboxes render into a single static namespace.
  Resource names use `{workspace}--{name}` for collision avoidance.
- **Managed**: The driver auto-creates/deletes a K8s namespace per workspace
  (`openshell-{gateway_id}-{workspace_name}`), creates a ServiceAccount in each,
  and copies OpenShift SCC annotations from the gateway namespace when present.
- **Operator**: Workspace names map 1:1 to pre-provisioned namespaces discovered
  through exactly one source: either a label selector
  (`operator_namespace_label`) or a drop-in allowlist file
  (`operator_namespace_file`). Sandbox creation fails closed if the workspace
  namespace is not in the current allowlist. Workspace deletion only removes
  gateway state; it never deletes or otherwise accesses the operator-managed
  Kubernetes namespace.

Workspace namespace modes assume exclusive control of the sandbox identity
resource chain. In shared and managed modes, only the gateway and its trusted
Agent Sandbox controller may administer the sandbox namespace, Sandbox CRs,
sandbox pods, or configured sandbox ServiceAccount. In operator mode, the
platform operator owns namespace lifecycle but must prevent other principals
from creating or mutating Sandbox CRs, creating sandbox pods with fabricated
owner references, or using the configured sandbox ServiceAccount. Treat adding
a namespace to the operator allowlist as granting this trust; the allowlist is
not a tenant isolation boundary.

## Runtime Model

The gateway stores platform state and delegates sandbox workload creation to
this driver over the compute-driver API. Kubernetes owns scheduling and pod lifecycle. The
`openshell-sandbox` supervisor inside each workload owns agent isolation,
credential injection, policy polling, logs, and the gateway relay.

## Sandbox Resource

The driver works with the `agents.x-k8s.io` `Sandbox` custom resource. It
detects the served Sandbox API at runtime, caches the selected API version for
the gateway process, and uses `v1beta1` when available before falling back to
`v1alpha1`. Restart the gateway after an in-place Agent Sandbox upgrade so the
driver can detect served API versions again. Driver events map Kubernetes object
state and platform events into the shared compute-driver protobuf surface used
by the gateway.

Kubernetes API calls use explicit timeouts so gRPC handlers do not block
indefinitely when the API server is slow or unavailable.

## Workspace Persistence

Sandbox pods use a PVC-backed `/sandbox` workspace. An init container seeds the
PVC from the image's original `/sandbox` contents on first start and writes a
sentinel so subsequent starts skip the copy.

This is a stopgap persistence model. It preserves user files across pod
rescheduling but duplicates the base workspace and does not automatically apply
image updates to existing PVCs. Future snapshotting should replace it.

Stop preserves the Agent Sandbox resource and workspace PVC while stopping
its pod. The driver sets `spec.operatingMode: Suspended` for `v1beta1` or
`spec.replicas: 0` for `v1alpha1`. Start sets `Running` or one replica for the
same resource, so the replacement pod mounts the existing claim. Delete is the
only lifecycle operation that removes the Sandbox resource and its owned
storage. The driver confirms the stop from the published `Suspended`
condition when available. Legacy `v1alpha1` controllers omit a zero replica
count from status, so the driver confirms that their backing pod is gone.

The workspace PVC size defaults to `workspace_default_storage_size`. Set
`workspace_storage_class` to pin the PVC to a specific `StorageClass`; an empty
value omits `storageClassName` so the cluster's default `StorageClass` applies.
Clusters with no default `StorageClass` must set this, otherwise the PVC stays
`Pending` and the sandbox never starts. Both fields can also be supplied at
runtime via `OPENSHELL_K8S_WORKSPACE_DEFAULT_STORAGE_SIZE` and
`OPENSHELL_K8S_WORKSPACE_STORAGE_CLASS`. Both apply only to the workspace PVC
that OpenShell provisions automatically; they have no effect when a `driver_config`
mount attaches an existing PVC under `/sandbox`, which skips the default PVC.

## Credentials, TLS, and Relay

The driver injects gateway callback configuration, sandbox identity, TLS client
material, and the supervisor SSH socket path into the workload. Driver-owned
values must override image-provided environment variables.

Sandbox pods run as `service_account_name` and keep
`automountServiceAccountToken: false`. The only Kubernetes token exposed to the
supervisor is an explicit, audience-bound projected token mounted at
`/var/run/secrets/openshell/token` for the one-shot `IssueSandboxToken`
bootstrap exchange.

The gateway uses the supervisor relay for connect, exec, and file sync. Sandbox
pods do not need direct external ingress for SSH.

## Opt-in Confidential Runtime Transport

The standalone driver can add one concrete TNG native sidecar for a pinned
confidential Kubernetes runtime. This path is disabled by default and does not
change ordinary Kubernetes sandbox rendering. When enabled, startup fails
unless all of the following operator-owned settings agree:

- `OPENSHELL_K8S_DEFAULT_RUNTIME_CLASS_NAME` pins the confidential
  `RuntimeClass`; sandbox requests cannot override it.
- `OPENSHELL_GRPC_ENDPOINT` is exactly
  `https://127.0.0.1:<TNG listen port>`.
- `OPENSHELL_K8S_TNG_VERIFIER_ADDRESS` is a private IPv4 address and
  `OPENSHELL_K8S_TNG_CALLBACK_BIND_ADDRESS` is a loopback address on the same
  port as the Pod-side TNG listener.
- `OPENSHELL_CLIENT_TLS_SECRET_NAME` names the existing sandbox TLS secret.

TNG listens on `127.0.0.1` inside the Pod and uses the guest attestation service
at `127.0.0.1:8006`. The callback bind address is returned to the gateway as a
listener requirement and is never placed in the Pod spec. Run the gateway with
`--exclusive-sandbox-callback=true`; the gateway then accepts sandbox
principals only on that distinct listener and rejects sandbox principals on
the primary listener.

Keep the primary listener unreachable from sandbox Pod networks. Callback
scope isolation classifies sandbox bearer principals; a client certificate
presented without a bearer token retains the upstream mTLS user semantics.

Example standalone-driver environment:

```shell
export OPENSHELL_K8S_DEFAULT_RUNTIME_CLASS_NAME=kata-remote
export OPENSHELL_GRPC_ENDPOINT=https://127.0.0.1:17670
export OPENSHELL_CLIENT_TLS_SECRET_NAME=openshell-client-tls
export OPENSHELL_K8S_TNG_ENABLED=true
export OPENSHELL_K8S_TNG_IMAGE=example.com/tng@sha256:<digest>
export OPENSHELL_K8S_TNG_VERIFIER_ADDRESS=10.0.0.8
export OPENSHELL_K8S_TNG_VERIFIER_PORT=9443
export OPENSHELL_K8S_TNG_CALLBACK_BIND_ADDRESS=127.0.0.2:17670
```

Repeat `--operator-pod-annotation key=value` for cluster-owned annotations
such as a pinned PodVM image and initdata selector. These values are applied
after sandbox-authored annotations. Use
`--workspace-access-mode ReadWriteOncePod` for an exclusive persistent
workspace.

The driver does not verify quotes, release keys, or persist attestation
evidence. TNG and the configured verifier enforce the prompt/response channel;
the guest attestation agent and Trustee policy remain the evidence boundary.

The driver forwards the canonical main-process specification to the process
supervisor and sets pod `restartPolicy: Never`. Main-process environment
overrides stay local to that child; the sidecar bootstrap retains the unmodified
provider environment used by later exec, editor, and SFTP sessions.

## Container Security Context

The default `combined` supervisor topology grants the sandbox agent container
the Linux capabilities the supervisor needs for namespace setup and process,
filesystem, and network policy enforcement.

The `sidecar` supervisor topology moves pod-level network setup into a root init
container. In the default process/binary-aware mode, the long-lived network
sidecar runs as UID 0 with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false`, drops default
Linux capabilities, and adds only `SYS_PTRACE` plus `DAC_READ_SEARCH` for
cross-UID workload `/proc` inspection. The agent container also runs as the
resolved sandbox UID/GID with `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` and
`capabilities.drop: ["ALL"]`.
Set `sidecar.process_binary_aware_network_policy = false` to run the network
sidecar as the configured non-root `sidecar.proxy_uid`, omit the extra `/proc`
inspection capabilities, and enforce endpoint/L7 network policy without
matching `policy.binaries`.
In this mode OpenShell preserves gateway session and SSH behavior, but the
process supervisor does not perform root-to-sandbox privilege dropping or
supervisor identity mount isolation. It still applies Landlock filesystem policy
and child seccomp filters where the kernel/runtime supports them. Network
endpoint and L7 policy remain enforced by the network sidecar, and
sidecar pods use a shared process namespace so the network sidecar can resolve
process/binary identity through `/proc/<entrypoint-pid>`.

Sidecar mode keeps gateway credentials in the network sidecar. The agent
container does not mount the projected service-account token used for sandbox
token bootstrap, does not mount the sandbox client TLS secret, and does not get
gateway callback environment variables. The process supervisor receives policy
and provider environment state from the sidecar over a local control socket in
the shared sidecar state volume. The sidecar accepts only the pre-workload
process-supervisor connection, authenticates its UID/GID/PID with peer
credentials, and removes the listener afterward. SSH relays use a Linux
abstract socket whose peer PID must match that authenticated supervisor. Both
supervisors exit if the control connection closes, coupling their container
restart lifecycle before a new authoritative client can be established.

The driver can request a Kubernetes AppArmor profile through
`app_armor_profile`.

Supported values are `Unconfined`, `RuntimeDefault`, and
`Localhost/<profile-name>`. An empty or unset value omits
`securityContext.appArmorProfile`. Helm deployments default sandbox agent
containers to `Unconfined` because runtime/default AppArmor profiles can block
the supervisor's network namespace mount setup on AppArmor-enabled nodes.

## GPU Support

When a sandbox requests GPU support, the driver checks node allocatable capacity
for `nvidia.com/gpu` and requests the configured GPU count in the workload spec.
When no count is set, the driver requests one GPU resource. The sandbox image
must provide the user-space libraries needed by the agent workload.

## Driver Config

Following RFC 0006, this driver accepts the selected
`SandboxTemplate.driver_config.kubernetes` block as
`DriverSandboxTemplate.driver_config`. The Kubernetes driver owns the
nested schema and currently accepts:

- `pod.node_selector`
- `pod.tolerations`
- `pod.runtime_class_name`
- `pod.priority_class_name`
- `containers.agent.resources.requests`
- `containers.agent.resources.limits`
- `containers.agent.volume_mounts[].name`
- `containers.agent.volume_mounts[].mount_path`
- `containers.agent.volume_mounts[].sub_path`
- `containers.agent.volume_mounts[].read_only`
- `volumes[].name`
- `volumes[].persistent_volume_claim.claim_name`
- `volumes[].persistent_volume_claim.read_only`

Nested keys inside the `kubernetes` block use snake_case. The top-level
`driver_config` envelope is keyed by driver names, so `kubernetes` is not part
of the nested schema.

Set this through the CLI with the public driver-keyed envelope. The gateway
forwards only the `kubernetes` object to this driver:

```shell
openshell sandbox create \
  --driver-config-json '{"kubernetes":{"pod":{"runtime_class_name":"kata-containers","node_selector":{"pool":"gpu"}}}}' \
  -- claude
```

Resource keys use native Kubernetes resource names and quantity strings. The
parser renders the keys listed above and rejects unknown fields.
`pod.runtime_class_name` maps to PodSpec `runtimeClassName` and overrides the
driver's configured `default_runtime_class_name`; the typed public
`SandboxTemplate.runtime_class_name` still takes precedence when set. Use the
public `--gpu` flag for the default GPU request, pass a count to `--gpu` for
counted GPU requests, and use `driver_config` only for additional driver-owned
resource details.

Use PVC volumes to mount existing Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims into the
agent container. PVC volumes and mounts default to read-only unless
`read_only: false` is set explicitly. Read-write access requires
`read_only: false` on both the PVC volume and each writable mount. The driver
rejects duplicate volume names, invalid DNS-1123 volume labels or PVC claim
subdomain names, mounts that reference unknown volumes, non-normalized or
protected mount paths, and absolute or parent-traversing `sub_path` values.

Any explicit driver-config mount under `/sandbox` disables the driver's
default `/sandbox` workspace PVC injection for that sandbox. Only the explicit
mount paths persist through the external PVC; other `/sandbox` paths come from
the current sandbox image.

```shell
openshell sandbox create \
  --driver-config-json '{
    "kubernetes": {
      "volumes": [{
        "name": "user-data",
        "persistent_volume_claim": {
          "claim_name": "pvc-user-data-123",
          "read_only": false
        }
      }],
      "containers": {
        "agent": {
          "volume_mounts": [
            {
              "name": "user-data",
              "mount_path": "/sandbox/.openshell/workspace",
              "sub_path": "workspace",
              "read_only": false
            },
            {
              "name": "user-data",
              "mount_path": "/sandbox/.openshell/memory",
              "sub_path": "memory",
              "read_only": false
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  }' \
  -- claude
```
